    - **Features:**
        
        - Command-line interface (CLI) using `argparse`.
            
        - Support for various file types (by reading raw bytes).
            
        - Different compression levels (e.g., faster but less compressed, slower but more compressed).
            
        - Robust error handling and logging.
            
        - **Parallelism (Optional but Recommended):** For tasks like frequency counting or processing independent blocks (as discussed previously), explore Python's `multiprocessing` or `concurrent.futures` modules.
            
    - **Documentation:** Crucially, document your design, implementation choices, and performance analysis.
        

## Beyond 24 Weeks: Continuous Learning and Contribution

- **Stay Updated:** Follow leading researchers and labs in data compression. Read proceedings from conferences like the **Data Compression Conference (DCC)** or **Picture Coding Symposium (PCS)**.
    
- **Contribute:** Get involved in open-source compression projects on GitHub. This is a great way to learn from others and refine your skills.
    
- **Network:** Join online communities (like r/compress on Reddit or Python-focused developer forums) or local meetups (if available) to discuss ideas.
    
- **Teach:** Try to explain concepts to others. Teaching is one of the best ways to solidify your own understanding.
    

### Essential Tools & Practices:

- **Git & GitHub:** Learn version control early. It's indispensable for managing your code.
    
    - **Book (Free Online):** "Pro Git Book."
        
        - **Link:** [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 "null")
            
- **IDEs/Editors:** VS Code, PyCharm, or Sublime Text are excellent for Python development.
    
- **Virtual Environments:** Use `venv` or `conda` to manage project dependencies.
    
- **Command Line:** Become comfortable using the terminal for running Python scripts and Git commands.
    

This is a demanding but incredibly rewarding journey. Your existing programming discipline from Java will be a huge asset. Be patient with yourself, celebrate small victories, and always enjoy the process of discovery!
