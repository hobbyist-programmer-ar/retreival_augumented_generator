        Reads all Markdown (.md) files from a given directory and returns their
        contents in a dictionary.

        The dictionary keys are the filenames (without the .md extension), and the
        values are the string contents of the files.

                            containing the markdown files.

        Returns:
            A dictionary where each key is a filename and each value is the
            content of that file.

        Raises:
            FileNotFoundError: If the specified directory_path does not exist.
            NotADirectoryError: If the specified path points to a file, not a directory.
